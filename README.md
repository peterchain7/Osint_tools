[https://www.osintcombine.com/post/foursquare-the-hidden-osint-gem](https://www.osintcombine.com/post/foursquare-the-hidden-osint-gem)

- It is often overlooked as an OSINT source because it is all about business locations, reviews and identifying what is around you at a given time (when using the app). However this platform has 60 million registered users, and 50 million active users every month as of 2019. That's significant and the platform is alive and well.

[Using dig command](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-dig-command-to-query-dns-in-linux/)

- `Testing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Using Gmail`

```bash
`Sender Policy Framework`
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) Definition:
SPF is a form of email authentication that defines a process to validate an email message that has been sent from an authorized mail server in order to detect forgery and to prevent spam.
```

```bash
`DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)` 
is an email authentication technique that allows the receiver to check that an email was indeed sent and authorized by the owner of that domain. This is done by giving the email a digital signature.
```

```bash
`standard email authentication method`
DMARC is a standard email authentication method. DMARC helps mail administrators prevent hackers and other attackers from spoofing their organization and domain. Spoofing is a type of attack in which the From address of an email message is forged.
```
[Network tools](https://mxtoolbox.com/NetworkTools.aspx)

- Network tools to test various network services and find some information that woulld be usefull for `penetration testing` and  `Open source Intelligence`

[https://ivre.rocks/](https://ivre.rocks/)

```bash
IVRE is an open-source network recon platform that uses Web interfaces, CLI tools, and a Python API to evaluate Nmap, Masscan, ZGrabd2, and Zeek/Bro findings. It collects data using well-known open-source tools (Nmap, Masscan, ZGrab2, ZDNS, and Zeek), saves it in a database (MongoDB is the suggested backend), and provides analysis tools.

IVRE include tools for executing Nmap against targets such as an organization or a range of locations, an entire country, a specific AS, or the full related IPv4 address space. Use your output results to differentiate between comparable hosts and other situations. Similarly, IVRE looks to be more suited to hackers, coders, or potential pen analyzers than the Shodan search engine, though hackers may use all three.
```
